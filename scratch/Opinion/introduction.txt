How to render an opinion article
--------------------------------

In this exercise I wanted to render a list of articles in an opinion style. The list is rendered on the left. If you tap one of the articles it appears on the right.

I implemented in opinion1.html and then reviewed it with a colleague.  The following points emerged:

1. Move the css and js moved into separate files. This creates a better separation of concerns.

2. Run the javascript code in an anonymous function. Don't pollute the global namespace. Be unobtrusive.

3. Use a closure in fillMenu to handle clicks.

4. In opinion1 I added methods to the Object prototype to add and remove classes. This is bad practice, because these methods may conflict with the work of others. Move these into distinct methods.

The output of the review is shown in opinion2.html.
